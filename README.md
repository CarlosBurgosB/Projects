# Projects
This repository contains 3 projects.

The first project is a complete evaluation of a e-waste pretreatment plant project.

The second is a greedy algorithm used to optimize a 3 item build for a tank in League of Legends, maximizing the time
the player can live against an AD Carry.

The thir one applies a decision tree to optimize the item choice when there's an uncertain outcome, for example, when a player has
to aim abilities. The best item is chosen using the best expected value criteria. **Must be opened in Colab to see Output of the code due to GitHub bug**.
