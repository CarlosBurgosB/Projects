# Projects
This repository contains 2 projects regarding applications of decision trees and greedy algorithms in videogame itemization.
The first one applies a decision tree to optimize the item choice when there's an uncertain outcome, for example, when a player has
to aim abilities. The best item is chosen using the best expected value criteria.
The second project is a greedy algorithm used to optimize a 3 item build for a tank in League of Legends, maximizing the time
the player can live against an AD Carry.
